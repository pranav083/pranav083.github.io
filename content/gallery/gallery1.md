#### Introduction:

The main aim of this project is to able to run the LVGL library on the st7735s 128 x 160 TFT display with using esp32. I am driving my system in the landscape mode you can go with portrait mode also but you to configure the setting properly(onward step 3).

**Earlier Tested** : I had tried to test with the Adafruit TFT library but it seems like their are lot of breaking changes in the library and it was not able to work properly. So, finally I decided to go with the generic library for the display st7735s.
